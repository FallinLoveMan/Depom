# perceptron-training
Perceptron training algorithm implemented in batch mode with python not using machine learning libraries.

Original code reads a TSV file and returns errors with for each epoch. It can be easily modified with e.g weights or epoch number.

Usage: perceptron.py -d [TSV_FILE_PATH] -o [TSV_OUT_PATH]
